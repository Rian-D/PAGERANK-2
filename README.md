Personal Project - Implemented the PageRank algorithm in Python using probabilistic reasoning and mathematical models.

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a Python program to calculate web page rankings based on the PageRank algorithm.
- Utilised Bayesian networks to model dependencies and improve probabilistic predictions.
- Applied Markov models to simulate the stochastic process of user navigation across web pages.
- Optimised the algorithm for scalability and accuracy by leveraging matrix operations.

Skills Acquired:
- Understanding of Bayesian reasoning and probabilistic graphical models.
- Deep knowledge of Markov processes and their application in web crawling and ranking systems.
- Introduced to NumPy library and how it can be used to carry out matrix operations and update Bayesian network probabilities - using this would've made my program a lot more efficient in terms of time and space complexity!
- Data analysis and debugging of complex mathematical algorithms.
